# Solar_power_prediction

- Predicitng solar power using weather data of the location

- we got the solar power generation data from a solar power plant in kentucky
- we combined the solar power generation data with weather data to train our models.

- The data set examples and cleaning the data can be observed in data preprocessing.

- All the models used are straight forward where we train the models withsolar power generation as target variable. Two step model is a type of aggregate model which uses weather data to predict solar radiation and this solar radiation is again used to make solar power prediction.

The model diagram is as follows
